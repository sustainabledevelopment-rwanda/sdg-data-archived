Open Git Bash terminal

You can use 'explorer .' to open the directory folder
Set directory (cd) to the folder you will clone the site into
git clone " [SSH URL] " - you can find this in GitHub ('Clone or download')
When cloned, update directory (cd ./) to the new folder

Make changes to files

git status (not required, but useful)
git add -A
git clone -m "MESSAGE" - enter name of the commit
git push

To add changes from the online repository to your local version, you can use 'git pull'.
If there are any changes online that aren't in your folder this will copy them across.
