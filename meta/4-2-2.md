computation_calculations: The number of children in the relevant age group who participate in an organized learning programme is expressed as a percentage of the total population in the same age range.

national_indicator_description:The participation rate in organized learning (one year before the official primary entry age), by sex as defined as the percentage of children in the given age range who participate in one or more organized learning programme, including programmes which offer a combination of education and care. Participation in early childhood and in primary education are both included. The age range will vary by country depending on the official age for entry to primary education. **Rationale** The indicator measures childrenâ€™s exposure to organized learning activities in the year prior to the start of primary school. A high value of the indicator shows a high degree of participation in organized learning immediately before the official entrance age to primary education
computation_calculation: The indicator can be calculated as the number of enrolments in organized learning programmes are reported by schools divided by the population in the age group one year below the official primary entry age.
