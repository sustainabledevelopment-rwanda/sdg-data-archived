computation_definitions: This indicator refers to the proportion of the population (adults) who feel safe walking alone in their neighbourhood.
national_indicator_description: The question measures the feeling of fear of crime in a context outside the house and refers to the immediate experience of this fear by the respondent by limiting the area in question to the “neighbourhood” or “your area” (various formulations depending on cultural, physical and language context).
computation_calculations: <p>The question used in victimization surveys is: How safe do you feel walking alone in your area/neighbourhood? Answer: Very safe/fairly safe/bit unsafe/very unsafe/ I never walk alone after dark/don’t know.</p> The proportion of population that feel safe is calculated by summing up the number of respondents who feel “very safe” and “fairly safe” and dividing the total by the total number of respondents.
