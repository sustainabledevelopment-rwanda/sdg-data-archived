computation_definitions: Percentage of children and young people in Grade 2 or 3 of primary education, at the end of primary education and the end of lower secondary education achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (a) reading and (b) mathematics. The minimum proficiency level will be measured relative to new common reading and mathematics scales currently in development
national_indicator_description: 
computation_disaggregation: Sex
computation_calculations >- The indicator is calculated as the percentage of children and/or young people at the relevant stage of education achieving or exceeding a pre-defined proficiency level in a given subject.  Performance above the minimum level, PLtn,s, above minimum = p where p is the percentage of students in a learning assessment at stage of education n, in subject s in any year (t-i) where 0 ? i ? 5, who has achieved the level of proficiency that is greater than a pre-defined minimum standard, Smin.  The minimum standard is defined by the global education community taking into consideration regional differences.
