  The unemployment rate is a useful measure of the underutilization of the
  labour supply. It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment
  for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are
  available for employment and actively seeking work. It is thus seen as an
  indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its
  labour force and of the performance of the labour market. Short-term time
  series of the unemployment rate can be used to signal changes in the business
  cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with recessionary
  periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as
  persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through
  an active job search.

  Persons in unemployment are defined as all those of working age (usually
  persons aged 15 and above) who were not in employment, carried out activities
  to seek employment during a specified recent period and were currently
  available to take up employment given a job opportunity. Persons in employment
  are defined as all those of working age (usually persons aged 15 and above)
  who, during a short reference period, were engaged in any activity to produce
  goods or provide services for pay or profit. The labour force corresponds to
  the sum of persons in employment and in unemployment.
